# Mandelbrot-set
This project has originated in 2017 and basic functionality was written in a few days, hence core code may look messy. Program allows user to generate image of chosen part of Mandelbrot set and display it using few built-in coloring systems and user-entered variables. It also allows to export and import the most interesting parts of set to .txt and .png files.  
GUI system was imported from one of my previous projects and hasn't changed much since original version, so it stands out of my present code.
